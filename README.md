### Preview

* local: `npm i && npm start` then `http://localhost:3000`
* live url: https://webdev-take-home-exercise.now.sh

### Basic functionality

* client side routing
* "load more" pagination
* Pop overs for each pet

### Notes

* client-side navigations rely on browser support of history api, fallback to location not provided yet
* async calls are Promise based thus won't work in IE11 (polyfill required)
